# A-Regression-Model-Analysis-of-Boston-Housing-Prices

## Project Background
The Boston Housing Dataset is a classic dataset used in machine learning and statistics for regression analysis. It was derived from information collected by the U.S. Census Service concerning housing in the area of Boston, Massachusetts. The dataset contains various attributes of houses in Boston suburbs, such as crime rate, property tax, accessibility to highways, and more. The target variable is the median value of owner-occupied homes, a key indicator for real estate market analysis.

## Objectives
The objective of this project is to build a regression model that can predict the median value of homes based on the given features. This prediction can be valuable for prospective buyers, sellers, and real estate investors in understanding housing market trends and making informed decisions.

## About Dataset
The dataset consists of 506 instances, each representing a suburb in Boston. There are 14 attributes including the median home value. Some of the features include : 
1. CRIM : per capita crime rate by town
2. ZN : proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.
3. INDUS : proportion of non-retail business acres per town.
4. CHAS : Charles River dummy variable (1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)
5. NOX : nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)
6. RM : average number of rooms per dwelling
7. AGE : proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940
8. DIS : weighted distances to five Boston employment centres
9. RAD : index of accessibility to radial highways
10. TAX : full-value property-tax rate per $10,000
11. PTRATIO : pupil-teacher ratio by town
12. B : 1000(Bk - 0.63)^2, where Bk is the proportion of blacks by town
13. LSTAT : % lower status of the population
14. MEDV : Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000's
